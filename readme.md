# State space search

Project implements and presents six state space search algoritmhs:
  - DFS
  - BFS
  - Dijkstra
  - A*
  - Greedy
  - Random search
 
To compile project, you need to have installed ncurses library.

Compile main.cpp with ncurses library linked: `$ g++ main.cpp -lncurses`

Input is expected to be passed as parameter, run it like this: `$ ./a.out ./yourInput.txt` 

If you wish to stop program after each iteration and see how it works step by step, go to schema.cpp and uncomment line 149.
